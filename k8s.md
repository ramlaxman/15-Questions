    - Simple application with its own environment i.e. program with web server and OS dependencies.
    - For a PHP app, that environment might include a webserver, a readable file system, and the PHP engine itself.
    - Docker suggested app should move to its own container like a private fancy room for own.
    - Room needs to be 
       - Managed; 
       - Access should be scheduled, distributed, load balanced; 
       - Data should be persistent; 
       - networking with other room is hard.
       
      *A container provides an isolated environment in which an app, together with its environment, can run. But those isolated containers often need to be managed and connected to the external world. Shared file systems, networking, scheduling, load balancing, and distribution are all challenges.*
